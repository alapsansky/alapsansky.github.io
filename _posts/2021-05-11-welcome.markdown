I made this website to showcase some of my bigger projects. Occassionally, I will blog about what's going on in my life, but if you want more continuous updates, consider following me on twitter at [@PhysicksofLife](https://twitter.com/PhysicksofLife). I tweet about my publications, presentations, and things of that nature on a more regular basis.

## Research

I am a biologist. First and foremost, I study evolution. I do that by applying techniques from physics, physiology, and morphology to uncover how organisms perform amazing behaviors in a complex world.

## Formal training

* **2016** - Bachelors of Science - [Gonzaga University](https://www.gonzaga.edu/)
* **2021** - PhD in Organismal Biology, Ecology, and Evolution - [University of Montana](https://hs.umt.edu/dbs/default.php)
* **starting 2021** - NSF Post-Doctoral Research Fellow - [University of British Columbia](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/)

## Technical skills

* **Kinematic analysis -** Analyzing movement to calculate forces and power exerted by and on organisms
* **Videography -** Using high-and low-tech cameras systems to reveal the details of animal behavior
* **Programming -** Concise coding (in R, MATLAB, C++, and web languages) to answer difficult questions and share knowledge
* **Computational Fluid Dynamics -** Using the OpenFOAM library to uncover the details of fluid flow
* **Evolutionary Modeling -** Using R and MATLAB to study the pattern and process of evolution
* **Morphometrics -** Using traditional and novel techniques to study shape and size in a comparative context

## Hobbies
Falconry, Hunting, Fishing, Programming, Gaming, Building, Climbing, Biking, Skiing
