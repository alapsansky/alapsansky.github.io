    title: About me
    text: I am a scientist, a teacher, an avid outdoorsman, a gamer, and a falconer.  Growing up in Ferndale, Washington, I spent the majority of my youth outside in nature asking questions about the way things work.  Both of my parents are scientists, so I think I owe my inquisitive mindset to them. They would often ask me questions like, “Why do you think that bird has such a long tail?” or “Why might different hawks have different wing shapes?”

    Those were the types of questions which occupied my mind as a kid, but I never thought I could make a career out of them. I went to Gonzaga University planning on becoming an engineer. I enjoyed math and physics and it seemed to pay well; that’s as much as I had thought about it. But after a few classes, I realized that my true passion lie in discovering new things, not just learning them.

    Finally, I figured out that I could indulge my love of math and physics while also exploring the biological questions I find so fascinating — and that’s what I do now. I use robust data and careful experimentation to understand how (as an organismal biology) and why (as an evolutionary biologist) organisms do what they do.
