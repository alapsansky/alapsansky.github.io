I'm Anthony Lapsansky, but you can call me Tony. Right now, I am an National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of British Columbia. In late 2021, I graduated from the University of Montana with my PhD in Organismal Biology, Ecology, and Evolution after working with Dr. Bret Tobalske in the [Flight Lab](http://hs.umt.edu/dbs/flightlab/). Now, I work under the guidance of Dr. Doug Altshuler in the [Altshuler Lab](https://altshuler.zoology.ubc.ca/). 

My PhD focused on the biomechanics and evolution of aquatic locomotion in birds. You can read my dissertation [here](https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=12862&context=etd). Now, I am working to understand the role of the brain in controlling movement in complex environments. I am funded by one of the NSF's [Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/postdoctoral-research-fellowships-biology-prfb). You can read the short version of my research plan [here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2109873&HistoricalAwards=false)

I write a blog post now and then. My plan is to do this more regularly, but we'll see if I can find the time!
