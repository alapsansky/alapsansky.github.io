    title: About me
    text: <p>I am a scientist, a teacher, an avid outdoorsman, a gamer, and a falconer.  Growing up in Ferndale, Washington, I spent the majority of my youth outside in nature asking questions about the way things work.</p><p>Both of my parents are scientists, so I think I owe my inquisitive mindset to them. They would often ask me questions like, “Why do you think that bird has such a long tail?” or “Why might different hawks have different wing shapes?”</p><p>Those were the types of questions which occupied my mind as a kid, but I never thought I could make a career out of them. I went to Gonzaga University planning on becoming an engineer. Eventually, I figured out that I could indulge my love of math and physics while also exploring the biological questions I find so fascinating — and that’s what I do now.<p>I use robust data and careful experimentation to understand how (as an organismal biology) and why (as an evolutionary biologist) organisms do what they do.</p>
