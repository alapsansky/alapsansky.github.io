I'm Anthony Lapsansky, but you can call me Tony. Right now, I am an National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of British Columbia. In late 2021, I graduated from the University of Montana with my PhD in Organismal Biology, Ecology, and Evolution after working with Dr. Bret Tobalske in the [Flight Lab](http://hs.umt.edu/dbs/flightlab/). Now, I work under the guidance of Dr. Doug Altshuler in the [Altshuler Lab](https://altshuler.zoology.ubc.ca/). 

My PhD focused on the biomechanics and evolution of aquatic locomotion in birds. You can read my dissertation [here](https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=12862&context=etd). Now, I am working to understand the role of the brain in controlling movement in complex environments. I am funded by one of the NSF's [Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/postdoctoral-research-fellowships-biology-prfb). You can read the short version of my research plan [here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2109873&HistoricalAwards=false)

Here are some of my current projects. More can be found by clicking on the navigation buttons.

I write a blog post now and then. My plan is to do this more regularly, but we'll see if I can find the time!

<!-- Thank you for buying the PRO version of Hydejack! ðŸŽ‰

More than one year ago I was looking for a blogging platform but couldn't find it:
One that would let me write posts in markdown with my own editor,
one that didn't look awful buy modern design standards, and one that felt snappy on a mobile phone.
That and more is now Hydejack. I hope you enjoy it [as much as I do](https://qwtel.com/).

## First Steps
Start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.

After you've familiarized yourself with Hydejack, you can delete the following folders and files
containing example content:
